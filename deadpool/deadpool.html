			<p class="intro">Welcome to the Deadpool character bio, nerds! I mean...True Believers! Brought to you by me, myself, and I: the fabulous Deadpool! I could have let some smelly pencil-pushing intern spell out my life story for you, but you deserve better.

So, here it is, straight from the Merc with a Mouth's mouth—every detail of my morally ambiguous, mentally unstable, innuendo-laden past. From my very first appearance in NEW MUTANTS #98, to my latest booty-kicking, comic relief-ing anti-heroics, to a third thing that I can't think of right now, this is the definitive history of Deadpool.

Okay, intro's over. Let the solemn origin story fade in?</p>

<article id="story"><div class="inline"><p>Call me Ishmael.

Just kidding. Don't do that.

Like any misunderstood hero, I probably had a difficult childhood that led to my career as a professional killer. That, or someone brainwashed me into murdering my parents. If I don't remember, does it really count? Or matter?

Let's just say that I was an orphan, a wizard put me on my aunt and uncle's doorstep, they raised me in secret, and then I went to a special magic school where a bald man regularly tried to murder me with voodoo.

Okay, that's not true...but I do have a scar on my forehead! Several, actually!

<p>Anyway, seriously, I joined the military at 17 years-old, but was discharged soon thereafter. So, naturally, I decided to become an assassin (which is, by the way, an incredibly fun word to write).

Then I met Wade and Mercedes Wilson, a young couple that nursed me back to health after an early failed job. Some may say that I killed them both in an attempt to steal Wade's identity, but guys, come on. I'm the real Wade Wilson.

While working as a hired gun, I met the expensively beautiful Vanessa Carlyle, and we made a perfectly dysfunctional pair. I then got an assignment to kill a British operative named Althea (important moment readers, I'm meeting my best friend here) but decided to kill everyone else instead. Doing this made my employers...unhappy. So they tried to kill Vanessa. Luckily, a special agent named Zoe Culloden—who'd been spying on me to try and convert me into some kind of messiah protector—rescued Vanessa. Weird subplot, I know.</p>

<p>Deadpool Origin and Tolliver
Cue my first life-defining moment: they gave me inoperable cancer. Low blow. I dumped Vanessa and joined a Weapon X program, where a few experiments served me up fresh and cancer free—with a side order of healing powers. Mmm, tasty! I joined their internal team of mercenaries, but my powers had some performance issues, so the department sent me off to die quietly in a place called Hospice. As if a painful, slow death could shut this mouth up. Clearly, these guys hadn't read any of my supporting literature.

There were a few other guys stuck in there with me, and we had a betting pool over who would kick the bucket first. We called it the dead pool, and because I'm a clever girl and because my name needed some kind of logic behind it, I adopted the moniker Deadpool. What? No, I disagree, it's not a reach at all.</p>

<p>Section Two: Electric Boogaloo (My Super Powers)
Let's be honest, my greatest super powers are wit and charm. But if you want a more literal interpretation of my superhuman abilities, I have a healing factor, which allows me to recover from grave injuries by regenerating entire body parts. I'm also an expert marksman and hand-to-hand combatant. It's true—I'm basically a ninja. And I speak a bunch of languages, like Japanese, German, and Spanish, but most of the time I pretend I don't. Danke schön.

Oh! And I have the ability to harness continuity errors and break the fourth wall. Pretty cool, I know.</p>

<p>Section Three: Return of the Paragraph (A List of People that Hate Me)
Let's face it: even the people that like me still, at the end of the day, end up hating me. So instead of having a list of allies and enemies like every other goody two shoes, I'll just put together a collection of people who have tried—or will try—to kill me. You comfortable? Here we go.

First, there's my work associates, like Incontinentia Buttocks, the Mercs for Money, Biggus Dickus, Bullseye, Tolliver, Taskmaster, and Brian. Then there's the people who have always hated me: T-Ray, the Boss, Madcap, Dr. Emrys Killebrew, Wizard, Typhoid, Sabretooth, and Thanos. Then there's the jilted ex-lovers: Death, Copycat, Anastasia, and Shiklah. And then we have the good guys who, generally, wouldn't mind if Kraven the Hunter turned my skin into a cummerbund. This list includes the X-Men, the Avengers, X-Force, S.H.I.E.L.D., the Secret Defenders, the Great Lakes Avengers, Cable, Siryn, Spider-Man, and of course my closest friend, Blind Al.</p></div></article>

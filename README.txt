This time I tried to get better at readability with whitespaces. I need to understand that other people than me may want to read my code. To get the codes easier to use for myself I varied between classes and ID. I learnt a lot about this excersise. 


Let´s go into the depth of the sites. 


Frontpage and Deadpool-site
The frontpage and the info-pages have almost the same background. But the color is not. This is therefore an id-tag.  

Title changed from last time to a more precise title, who helps with the SEO. The names in the classes/ID were written in a understable way. By this I mean that I understand which tag goes where. Instead of table, I used the body as a base for the box. 

When I tried to validate my codes, I got a value-error telling me that the hex-code in this task was invalid (line 199, 203, 207). I don`t know why, but it is weird that it worked in Sublime, but not Dreamweaver. I decided not to remove it, because the task told me it was these colors. I tried rgba, but was unsure I could and I ran short on time, I also asked my classmates, and they said that they had no problems with it.


Power-box
This is a class, so it can be used on similar pages. I needed to change my program to Sublime instead of Dreamweaver because the color in this box wouldn`t show up in Dreamweaver, this changed when I switched programs. Odd. I also added comments to my code, so others may know where they can change things and to help them understand the code better. Colspace added to span the colonne over several others. Article id added because this is an article. 


By the way, I am sorry that this sheet was so terrible. This task came like a big surprise, and I have recently worked two weeks for the school. I need to take a course or something on how to handle stress, and not to feel like a headless chicken running around and around herself.
